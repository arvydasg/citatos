# About

This will be a page where I will store all the quotes that I have read/heard/saw
during my travel years. I like to keep things. And share with others.

Trying to work with Django as well as databases. It's completely new for me, but
I like how much control it gives me.

Not paying much importance to front end stuff with this project.
